Hi, I'm Melanie Walsh, and I'm currently finishing my PhD in 20th- and 21st-century American literature at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://english.artsci.wustl.edu/people/melanie-walsh). Starting in August 2019, I will be a Postdoctoral Associate in Information Science at [Cornell University](https://infosci.cornell.edu/).

My dissertation, *Postwar Redux: The Recirculation of Postwar American Fiction and the Rise of Networked Readers in the 21st Century*, narrated two intertwined literary histories: the emergence of what I call "networked reading" and the resurrected lives of post-1945, pre-2000 American literary history as told by networked readers. Through the lens of #BlackLivesMatter tweets, licensed Amazon fanfiction, underground libraries, Tumblr selfies, and more,  I examined how the writings of James Baldwin, Kurt Vonnegut, Sandra Cisneros, and Chris Kraus were remediated and repurposed by people over the last two decades.

My analyses in *Postwar Redux* were bolstered by the use of digital and computational tools, and I am passionate about bringing computational methods to humanistic inquiry in my research as well as my teaching. At Cornell, I am excited to be designing and teaching an Introduction to Cultural Analytics course for humanities students with no previous programming background.
