Hi, I'm Melanie Walsh, and I'm a Postdoctoral Associate in Information Science at [Cornell University](https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/walsh). I received my PhD in English & American Literature from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://english.wustl.edu/). My research interests include digital humanities, cultural analytics, social media, and American literature & culture---preferably all of the above combined.

I recently designed and taught an [undergraduate course](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/features/welcome.html) that prepares students in the humanities to analyze cultural materials with digital and computational tools. The course includes an introduction to the programming language Python.

I'm also at work on a book project, [*When Postwar American Fiction Went Viral*](/book), which follows the social media afterlives of four American authors.

You can check out my [CV](/cv), [teaching](/teaching), [digital projects](/digitalprojects), or [infrequent blog thoughts](/blog). If you'd like to reach me, you can email me [here](mailto:melanie.walsh@cornell.edu): melanie dot walsh at cornell dot edu.
