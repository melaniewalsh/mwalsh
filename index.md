I'm Melanie Walsh, a PhD candidate in 20th- and 21st-century American literature at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://english.artsci.wustl.edu/people/melanie-walsh). I'm working on a dissertation that follows postwar American literature as it's been recirculated by networks of readers in the 21st century, tentatively titled *Postwar Redux*.

Other things I'm excited about include: [*Tweets of a Native Son*](http://tweetsofanativeson.com/), a website that features data visualizations about James Baldwin's digital afterlives; ["American Fiction in the Social Media Age,"](https://afsma17.com/) an undergraduate literature course about new media and the contemporary American novel; the [Digital Approaches Reading Group](https://sites.wustl.edu/darg/), a community of faculty, grad students, and staff broadly interested in "digital approaches" that I helped establish.

In my spare time, I play shooting guard for the English department's intramural basketball team, "Negative Capability" (the Keats kind), where the nickname on the back of my jersey is "Eyre Jordan" (the BrontÃ« kind). I also make Twitter bots on my raspberry pi [![raspberry pis are just the cutest ](https://thinger.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/raspberry-pi-logo-1-600x711.png){:height="30px" }](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), such as a [memed-out William Carlos Williams](https://twitter.com/sosweetbot) and a bot that captures [mentions of James Baldwin](https://twitter.com/TweetsNativeSon).
