Hi, I'm Melanie Walsh, and I'm a Postdoctoral Associate in Information Science at [Cornell University](https://infosci.cornell.edu/). I'm currently designing an undergraduate course that will prepare students in the humanities to analyze cultural materials (such as books, movies, and social media posts) with digital and computational tools. I received my PhD in English & American Literature from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://english.wustl.edu/).

My research interests include digital humanities, cultural analytics, American literature, and social media---preferably all of the above combined. You can check out my [CV](/cv), [teaching](/teaching), [digital projects](/digitalprojects), [infrequent blog thoughts](/blog), or [manuscript-in-progress](/book). If you'd like to reach me, you can shoot me an email at melanie dot walsh at cornell dot edu.
