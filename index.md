Hi, I'm Melanie Walsh, and I'm a Postdoctoral Associate in Information Science at [Cornell University](https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/walsh). I received my PhD in English & American Literature from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://english.wustl.edu/). My research interests include digital humanities, cultural analytics, social media, and American literature & culture---preferably all of the above combined.

At Cornell, I'm designing and teaching an undergraduate course that prepares students in the humanities to analyze cultural materials---such as books, movies, historical records, and social media posts---with digital and computational tools. The course includes an introduction to the programming language Python.

You can check out my [CV](/cv), [teaching](/teaching), [digital projects](/digitalprojects), [infrequent blog thoughts](/blog), or [manuscript-in-progress](/book). If you'd like to reach me, you can email me [here](mailto:melanie.walsh@cornell.edu): melanie dot walsh at cornell dot edu.
