    "The first few times that I tried to learn Python — yes, it took me multiple tries! — it felt like learning a bunch of made-up rules about an imaginary universe. Turns out Python *is* kind of like an imaginary universe with made-up rules, and that's part of what makes it fun. But it can also make learning Python difficult if you don't really know what the imaginary universe looks like, or how it functions, or how it relates to your universe and your specific goals — such as doing text analysis or making a Twitter bot or creating a network visualization.\n",

    "We're going to demonstrate what Python looks like in action, so you can get a feel for its structure and flow. Don't get too bogged down in the details for now. Just try to get a sense — at an abstract level — of how Python works and how you might use it.\n",
