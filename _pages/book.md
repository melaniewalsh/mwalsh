My current book project, *Postwar Redux: The Recirculation of Postwar American Fiction and the Rise of Networked Readers in the 21st Century*, explores how and why people in the last two decades, inspired by the rise of the internet and social media, recirculated and reimagined American literary texts published in the late-twentieth century through #BlackLivesMatter tweets, licensed Amazon fanfiction, “streetfighter” websites, Tumblr selfies, and more. Throughout the book, I rely on digital and computational tools, and I demonstrate how internet data about literature’s proliferating social lives enriches the fields of literary studies, digital humanities, and cultural analytics.
