I'm currently at work on a book project, *When Postwar American Fiction Went Viral*, which follows the social media afterlives of four American authors — James Baldwin, Kurt Vonnegut, Sandra Cisneros, and Chris Kraus. Each of these authors' writings and biographies were repurposed and reshared by online communities — in #BlackLivesMatter tweets, licensed Amazon fanfiction, “streetfighter” websites, Tumblr selfies, and more. With the help of computational methods, archival research, and close reading, I piece together these four remarkable reading histories. 

When stitched together, I argue that these histories represent a broader shift in American reading culture spurred by the internet and social media. Readers in these digital environments treat “canonical” postwar American literary texts not as objects to be passively consumed but as content to be used, reshared, and inserted directly into the fabric of social life and social media.
